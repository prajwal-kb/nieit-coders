            The project objective is to book cinema tickets in online. The Ticket Reservation System is an Internet based 
            application that can be accessed by anyone who has an internet connection. This application will reserve the tickets. 
            This online ticket reservation system provides a website for a cinema hall where any user of internet can access it. 
            User is required to login to the system and needs a credit card for booking the tickets.

            Tickets can be collected at the counter and Watching movies with family and friends in theatres is one of the best medium 
            of entertainment after having a hectic schedule. But all this excitement vanishes after standing in hours in long 
            queues to get tickets booked. The website provides complete information regarding currently running movies on all the 
            screens with details of show timings, available seats. Ticket reservations are done using credit card and can be cancelled if needed. 
            Our online tickets reservation system is one of the best opportunities for those who cannot afford enough time to get their tickets reserved 
            standing in long queues. People can book tickets online at any time of day or night. Our reservation system also provides option 
            to cancel the tickets which are reserved previously.
